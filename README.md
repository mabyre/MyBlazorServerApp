## Separate Code and View

* Look in Pages/Counter seperate by derivate from ComponentBase

## Use of interface in Data Services

Can be useful if another Razor page would like to display Weather data

## Add a TodoList

Sample ToDoList in Balzor

## Creation of Class Razor Librairie

First I had to find how to use "git move" to move this project to a subdirectory then to add the class blazor librairy. 

To Be Done.

## Blazor Dynamic Component

Dynamicly change the html content using DynamicComponent to load html Blazor components

<img style="margin: 10px" src="Images/2023-03-03_10h29_48.png" alt="TemplateVisualStudio Ribbon transform Icon Image" />

I say "Html component" because there is no much more in those Blazor Component sample shoud be enhanced.
